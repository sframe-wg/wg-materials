# SFrame Working Group Materials

The SFrame Working Group is
[chartered](https://sframe-wg.github.io/wg-materials/charter) to produce
protocols that will enable end-to-end protection for real-time media.

This repository is used to manage working group materials.  This will contain
live copies of the charter, meeting agendas, minutes, presentations, and other
supplementary material.

Formal records for the working group are maintained on the
[IETF datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sframe/about/).
