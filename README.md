The SFrame Working Group is producing protocols that will enable end-to-end
protection for real-time media.

This repository is used to manage working group materials.  This will contain
live copies of the charter, meeting agendas, minutes, presentations, and other
supplementary material.

Formal records for the working group are maintained on the
[IETF datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sframe/about/).

[Contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING) outline how to participate.
